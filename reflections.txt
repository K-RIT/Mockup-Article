Your response goes here!
Actually i learnt every basic tags through link provided by your side - "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element". Also "figure" tag was new for me.
Mocking the web page was easy to understand. 
Concept of "figure" tag was quite difficult.
I have used  MDN HTML Element Reference page for clearing my doubts. Also i have used W3c validator to check errors in my webpage.
